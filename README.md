OS Memory Paging Simulator
Overview
This project is a Python-based simulation of the Memory Paging mechanism, a fundamental concept in modern Operating Systems. It demonstrates how the OS manages memory by mapping logical addresses generated by processes into physical addresses in RAM.
Features
 * Address Translation: Simulates the conversion of Logical Addresses to Physical Addresses using Page Tables.
 * Page Table Management: Handles page entries and frame allocation logic.
 * Parameter Customization: Supports configurable Page Sizes and Memory Limits to observe different system behaviors.
 * Detailed Logs: Provides a step-by-step breakdown of how the Offset and Page Number are calculated.
Technical Concepts Implemented
 * Paging & Segmentation: Understanding how memory is divided into fixed-size blocks.
 * Logical to Physical Mapping: Implementation of the formula: Physical Address = (Frame Number \times Page Size) + Offset.
 * Memory Management Unit (MMU) Logic: Mimicking the hardware-level translation process.
How to Run
 * Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ahdallah-harraz/OS-Memory-Paging-Simulator.git
   
Run the script:
python paging_simulator.py
